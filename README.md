# 🚀 Digg_Deeper 15 Days Challenge

Welcome to my **Digg_Deeper 15 Days Challenge**!  
The goal: sharpen my problem-solving and coding skills by solving **3 LeetCode problems a day** for 15 days.

I'll be documenting each day’s progress right here, along with code solutions and brief notes.

## 📘 Day 1 - August 2, 2025

**Problems Solved:**
1. [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)  
   ➤ Implemented Kadane’s Algorithm for optimal performance  
2. [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)  
   ➤ Solved using in-place array manipulation with O(1) extra space  
3. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)  
   ➤ Used a hashmap for efficient O(n) solution

## 📘 Day 2 - August 3, 2025

**Problems Solved:**
1. [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)  
2. [Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)  
3. [Another Problem Name]  

🧠 **Reflection:**  
Example: Focused on using stacks and two-pointer strategies today.


🧠 **Reflection:**  
Solid start! Felt comfortable with array manipulation and hashmap logic. Focus tomorrow: practice a medium difficulty dynamic programming problem.
