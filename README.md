## 📘 Day 1 - August 2, 2025

**Problems Solved:**
1. [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)  
   ➤ Implemented Kadane’s Algorithm for optimal performance  
2. [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)  
   ➤ Solved using in-place array manipulation with O(1) extra space  
3. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)  
   ➤ Used a hashmap for efficient O(n) solution


🧠 **Reflection:**  
Solid start! Felt comfortable with array manipulation and hashmap logic. Focus tomorrow: practice a medium difficulty dynamic programming problem.

## 📘 Day 2 - August 3, 2025

**Problems Solved:**
1. [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)  
2. [Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)  
3. [Another Problem Name]  

🧠 **Reflection:**  
Example: Focused on using stacks and two-pointer strategies today.


## 📘 Day 3 - August 4, 2025

**Problems Solved:**
1. [Valid Anagram (LeetCode 242)](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)  
   ➤ Compared sorted strings and used hash maps for optimized checking.  
2. [Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String (LeetCode 28)](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)  
   ➤ Applied Python's built-in `find()` and also practiced manual sliding window approach.  
3. [Group Anagrams (LeetCode 49)](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)  
   ➤ Used a hash map with tuple-sorted keys to group anagrams efficiently.

🧠 **Reflection:**  
Focused on string manipulation and hash map use cases today. Grouping anagrams helped solidify understanding of key design using immutable structures like tuples. Feeling more confident with intermediate string problems!

## 📘 Day 4 - August 5, 2025

**Problems Solved:**
1. [Subarray Sum Equals K (LeetCode 560)](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)  
   ➤ Solved using prefix sum and hashmap to achieve O(n) complexity.  
2. [Longest Palindromic Substring (LeetCode 5)](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)  
   ➤ Used expand-around-center approach for O(n²) solution. Also reviewed dynamic programming technique.  
3. [Valid Parentheses (LeetCode 20)](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)  
   ➤ Reinforced stack-based approach for matching brackets.

🧠 **Reflection:**  
Today’s problems required combining hash maps, sliding windows, and stack-based logic. Especially enjoyed solving the palindrome problem by understanding how to expand from the center. Getting better at spotting optimal patterns!

## 📘 Day 5 - August 6, 2025

**Problems Solved:**
1. [Binary Search (LeetCode 704)](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)  
   ➤ Implemented classic binary search (iterative and recursive) for sorted arrays.  
2. [Linked List Cycle (LeetCode 141)](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)  
   ➤ Used Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare approach).  
3. [Trapping Rain Water (LeetCode 42)](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)  
   ➤ Solved using two-pointer approach to optimize space and time.

🧠 **Reflection:**  
Covered a wide range of topics today—search algorithms, linked list traversal, and an advanced two-pointer technique for a classic array problem. The rainwater problem was tricky but fun to break down!

📘 Day 6 - August 7, 2025
Problems Solved:

Search Insert Position (LeetCode 35)
➤ Used binary search to find the correct insertion point in O(log n) time.

Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted (LeetCode 167)
➤ Applied the two-pointer technique on a sorted array for optimal performance.

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (LeetCode 3)
➤ Implemented sliding window approach using a hash set for O(n) solution.

🧠 Reflection:
Today was packed with foundational techniques like binary search, two-pointers, and sliding window. These patterns are recurring themes in interviews, and solving them under time constraints helped reinforce clarity and speed. Sliding window problems are becoming more intuitive!

📘 Day 7 - August 8, 2025
Problems Solved:

132 Pattern (LeetCode 456)
➤ Solved using a monotonic stack approach from right to left to achieve O(n) complexity.

Reverse Linked List II (LeetCode 92)
➤ Implemented in-place reversal for a sublist between two positions using pointer manipulation.

Sliding Window Maximum (LeetCode 239)
➤ Used a deque to maintain the index of potential maximums for each window in O(n) time.

🧠 Reflection:
Today’s problems were a solid mix of stack-based patterns, linked list manipulation, and deque-based sliding window logic. The 132 Pattern was tricky at first but became clear after understanding the reverse iteration approach. Linked list reversal sharpened my pointer skills, and the sliding window maximum reinforced the importance of data structures like deque for efficiency.
